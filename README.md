# Remix + Astro + Hono Boilerplate

This is a boilerplate for building web applications with [Remix](https://remix.run), [Astro](https://astro.build) and [Hono](https://hono.dev).

## Overview

I plan to add the following:

- [x] Hono (for server)
- [x] react-router v7 (aka Remix v3, for app)
- [x] Astro (for static content)
- [x] TypeScript
- [x] Postgres
- [x] DrizzleORM (to operate Postgres)
- [x] Redis
- [x] BullMQ (via Redis)
- [x] Minio
- [x] TailwindCSS
- [x] shadcn/ui
- [x] Auth (via Lucia)
- [x] BiomeJS
- [x] tsup
- [x] Stripe
- [ ] Emails (via Resend / Nodemailer)
  - [x] Magic Link / OTP

This covers all I need for building an app with a web frontend and an API backend.
